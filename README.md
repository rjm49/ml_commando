# Cambridge ML Commando
### At the Cambridge Computer Laboratory

Welcome to the Cambridge ML Commando Course.  This is a summer course run at [Cambridge University](https://cam.ac.uk)'s [Computer Laboratory](https://cst.cam.ac.uk), for undergraduates not necessarily from the Lab itself.  It has been run since 2018 by [Russell Moore](https://russellmoo.re).

You can get started by learning how to [install your ML Commando toolkit](http://ml-commando.russellmoo.re/setup/).
